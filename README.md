## Eat & Meet

This is an app we built in less than 10 hours. This will help you set up a
dinner appointment with friends or other people whose phone number you may have.

Once you submit your form, restaurants will be searched for within the vicinity.
The available choices of food are displayed as options for each invitee to vote
on.

The category with the most votes will be selected with the highest rated
restaurant within the searched area winning.

### Setup:

```
1.  Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the values
2.  `bundle install`
3.  `shotgun config.ru`
```
